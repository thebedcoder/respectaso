**Free, open-source ASO keyword research tool for macOS. No API keys. No accounts. No data leaves your machine.**

RespectASO helps iOS developers research App Store keywords privately. Download the `.dmg`, drag to Applications, and get keyword popularity scores, difficulty analysis, competitor breakdowns, and download estimates — all without sending your research data to third-party services.

---

## Why RespectASO?

Most ASO tools require paid subscriptions, API keys, and send your keyword research to their servers. RespectASO takes a different approach:

- **No API keys or credentials needed** — uses only the public iTunes Search API
- **Runs entirely on your machine** — all API calls originate from your local network
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking** — zero data sent to any third party
- **Free and open-source** — AGPL-3.0 licensed, forever
- **Native Mac app** — download the `.dmg`, drag to Applications, done

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Keyword Popularity** | Estimated popularity scores (1–100) derived from a 6-signal model analyzing iTunes Search competitor data |
| **Difficulty Score** | 7 weighted sub-scores (rating volume, dominant players, rating quality, market age, publisher diversity, app count, content relevance) with ranking tier analysis |
| **Ranking Tiers** | Separate difficulty analysis for Top 5, Top 10, and Top 20 positions — because breaking into the top 5 is different from reaching the top 20 |
| **Download Estimates** | Estimated daily downloads per ranking position based on search volume, tap-through rates, and conversion rates |
| **Competitor Analysis** | See the top 10 apps ranking for each keyword with ratings, reviews, genre, release date, and direct App Store links |
| **Country Opportunity Finder** | Scan up to 30 App Store regions at once to find which countries offer the best ranking opportunities for your keyword |
| **Multi-Keyword Search** | Research up to 20 keywords at once (comma-separated) |
| **Multi-Country Search** | Search the same keyword across multiple countries simultaneously |
| **App Rank Tracking** | Add your apps and see where you rank for each keyword alongside competitor data |
| **Search History** | Browse past keyword research with sorting, filtering, and expandable detail views |
| **CSV Export** | Export your keyword research data for use in spreadsheets |
| **ASO Targeting Advice** | Automatic keyword classification (Sweet Spot, Hidden Gem, Low Volume, Avoid, etc.) based on popularity vs. difficulty |

## Quick Start

### 1. Download

**→ [Download RespectASO.dmg](https://github.com/respectlytics/respectaso/releases/latest)** (macOS 12+)

### 2. Install

Open the `.dmg` and drag **RespectASO** into your **Applications** folder.

### 3. Launch

Open RespectASO from Applications (or Spotlight: ⌘ Space → "RespectASO"). The app window opens automatically — type a keyword, select a country, and click Search.

> **First launch:** If macOS shows a security dialog, right-click the app → Open → Open. This is only needed once — the app is code-signed and notarized by Apple.

### Updating

When an update is available, a banner appears on the Dashboard with release notes and a **Download Update** button. Download the new `.dmg`, drag to Applications (replace the old version), and relaunch. Your data is preserved — it lives in `~/Library/Application Support/RespectASO/`, separate from the app bundle.

### Data Location

Your keywords, search history, and settings are stored at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/RespectASO/
```

This data survives app updates and deletions. Delete this folder only if you want a completely fresh start.

<details>
<summary><strong>🐳 Docker (legacy)</strong></summary>

Docker was the original distribution method. While still supported, we recommend switching to the native Mac app for a simpler experience.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running

#### Install via Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/respectlytics/respectaso.git
cd respectaso
docker compose up -d
```

Open **[http://localhost](http://localhost)** in your browser.

#### Updating (Docker)

```bash
cd respectaso
git pull
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

#### Migrating from Docker to Native App

Your existing data carries over. Run this one-time migration:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/respectlytics/respectaso/main/desktop/migrate-from-docker.sh | bash
```

Then install the native app and verify your data is intact. Once confirmed:

```bash
docker compose down     # Stop the container
docker compose down -v  # Also remove the volume (only after confirming native app works)
```

## How Scoring Works

RespectASO uses the **iTunes Search API** as its only data source — no Apple Search Ads credentials, no scraping, no paid APIs.

### Popularity Score (1–100)

A 6-signal composite model that estimates how often a keyword is searched:

| Signal | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Result count | 0–25 pts | How many apps appear for this keyword |
| Leader strength | 0–30 pts | Rating volume of the top-ranking apps |
| Title match density | 0–20 pts | How many apps use this exact keyword in their title |
| Market depth | 0–10 pts | Whether strong apps appear deep in results |
| Specificity penalty | -5 to -30 | Adjusts for generic terms that inflate result counts |
| Exact phrase bonus | 0–15 pts | Rewards multi-word keywords with precise matches |

### Difficulty Score (1–100)

A 7-factor weighted system that estimates how hard it is to rank:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Rating volume | 30% | How many ratings competitors have |
| Dominant players | 20% | Whether a few apps dominate (100K+ ratings) |
| Rating quality | 10% | Average star ratings of competitors |
| Market maturity | 10% | How long competitors have been on the App Store |
| Publisher diversity | 10% | Whether results come from many publishers or a few |
| App count | 10% | Total number of relevant results |
| Content relevance | 10% | How well competitors match the keyword |

**Interpretation:** Very Easy (&lt;16) · Easy (16–35) · Moderate (36–55) · Hard (56–75) · Very Hard (76–90) · Extreme (91+)

### Download Estimates

A 3-stage pipeline estimates daily downloads per ranking position:

1. **Popularity → Daily Searches** — piecewise-linear mapping calibrated against real App Store observations
2. **Position → Tap-Through Rate** — power-law decay from position #1 (30%) to position #20 (0.06%)
3. **Tap → Install Conversion** — range of 35%–55% for free apps

Results are shown as conservative–optimistic ranges per position, with tier breakdowns for Top 5, Top 6–10, and Top 11–20.

## Configuration

<details>
<summary><strong>Custom Local Domain (Docker only)</strong></summary>

If running via Docker, you can use a cleaner URL. Add this to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1  respectaso.private" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then access the tool at **[http://respectaso.private](http://respectaso.private)**

The `.private` TLD is reserved by [RFC 6762](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6762) and avoids conflicts with macOS mDNS resolution (unlike `.local`).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12** + **Django 5.1**
- **pywebview** — native macOS WebKit window
- **SQLite** — local single-user database
- **wsgiref** — built-in Python WSGI server
- **WhiteNoise** — efficient static file serving
- **Tailwind CSS** (CDN) — dark theme UI
- **PyInstaller** — macOS `.app` bundle

## Privacy

RespectASO is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **100% local** — the tool runs entirely on your machine as a native app
- **No accounts** — no registration, no login, no user tracking
- **No telemetry** — zero analytics, zero phone-home, zero data collection
- **No API keys** — uses only the public iTunes Search API (no credentials required)
- **No third-party services** — all API calls go directly from your machine to Apple's public API
- **Your data stays yours** — keyword research, competitor analysis, and search history never leave your network

We built RespectASO because we believe developers should be able to research keywords without handing their competitive intelligence to a third party.
