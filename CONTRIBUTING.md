## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their pull request can be merged. This is handled automatically via [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io) — you'll be prompted when you open your first PR.

The CLA preserves our ability to offer dual licensing (AGPL-3.0 for open source, commercial for enterprises).

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python

- Follow Django conventions and PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused — one function, one purpose

### Templates (HTML)

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow the dark theme design system (`bg-slate-900`, `bg-[#1e293b]`, etc.)
- Follow existing template patterns in the repository

### JavaScript

- Vanilla JS preferred — no frameworks in templates
- Use `const` and `let`, not `var`
- Use `async/await` for async operations

## What Makes a Good PR

- **Focused:** One feature or fix per PR
- **Tested:** Include steps to verify the change
- **Documented:** Update docs if behavior changes
- **Clean:** No unrelated changes or formatting noise
